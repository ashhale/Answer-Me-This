Demo 1: Tree Diagram
============================

Start with 4 things open: 2 command prompts and a windows explorer all
in the same directory, plus a browser open

In Command Prompt 1:
python                                  # Start python
execfile('initLDT_stage3cancer.py')     # Create LDT with stage3cancer data
dt, root = dt1()                            # dt1() reads from stage3cancer.csv
                                            # and writes to stage3cancer_v2.csv
dt.getDOT(outFile = 'test.dot')         # Generate file test.dot


In Command Prompt 2:
dot -Tsvg -O test.dot


In Windows Explorer Window:
Double-click test.dot.svg               # Or drag-drop to browser


In Browser:
View, discuss, zoom tree diagram


Demo 2: Q&A (Q&A like ***base DecisionTree***, not LearningDecisionTree)
========================================================================
If not yet done:
    python                                  # Start python
    execfile('initLDT_stage3cancer.py')     # Create LDT with stage3cancer data

ans = interview()
ans
ans['solution_path']
ans['"pgstat"=0']


Demo 3: Adding a new Training Record
====================================
python
execfile('initLDT_stage3cancer.py')
dt, root = dt1()                            # dt1() reads from stage3cancer.csv
                                            # and writes to stage3cancer_v2.csv
dt.getDOT(outFile = 'test.dot', allProbsOnLeaf = True)  # Do dot in other window
walkAndRecord()                             # Non-interactive walk through
                                            # questions while recording, and
                                            # regenerates tree
dt.show_training_data()                     # Note new sample_147
dt.getDOT(outFile = 'test_v2.dot', allProbsOnLeaf = True)  # Tree is different!

    # So far, have shown ability to:
    #   * Walk tree while recording actions
    #   * Use recorded steps to create seed training record
    #   * Tweak seed record
    #   * Add training data and regen tree all dynamically with one tree object

dt.saveTrainingData()                       # Save to stage3cancer_v2.csv

dt, root = dt2()                            # dt2() reads stage3cancer_v2.csv
                                            # and writes stage3cancer_v3.csv
dt.show_training_data()                     # Note new sample_147
dt.getDOT(outFile = 'test_v3.dot', allProbsOnLeaf = True)  # Same as test_v2.dot

    # Now confirmed saving new training data works, and it can be read/used


Demo 4: Showing Poor and Good Training Data
===========================================
Not ready, need to explore data and try many runs manually to come up with
something


Demo 5: Interactive Q&A with Recording and Seeding New Training Record
======================================================================

Miscellaneous Notes
===================

To examine an individual node with serial number 6:
dt.getNodeDict()[6].display_node()          # dt.getNodeDict()[6] is a DTNode
dt.getNodeDict()[6].get_children()          # Returns a list
dt.getNodeDict()[6].get_children()[0]       # A DTNode, child index 1
for child in dt.getNodeDict()[6].get_children(): child.display_node()
